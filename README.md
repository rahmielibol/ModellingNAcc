# Modelling Nucleus Accumbens
A Computational Model from Single Cell to Circuit Level

A computational model are established for nucleus accumbens. The model begins by focusing on modelling the behavior of single cells and then build a holistic model of nucleus accumbens considering the effect of synaptic currents. The results are verified the validity of the model by showing the consistency of simulation results with the empirical data.
